## 1. Shop Overview

**E‑Com67** is an experimental e‑commerce shop operating at the intersection of technology, vibes, and questionable levels of confidence.

- **Shop Name**: E‑Com67
- **Founded By**: ShiWei
- **Founded**: In a moment of inspiration that may or may not have occurred after midnight
- **Type**: Online E‑commerce Store
- **Core Philosophy**: Ship fast, vibe harder

E‑Com67 exists to prove that with enough determination, caffeine, and copy‑paste, anything is deployable.

## 2. The Founder

E‑Com67 was built by **ShiWei**, a widely self‑acknowledged:

- GOATED vibe coder 🐐
- Builder of systems that “just work” (eventually)
- Godfather of skibidi (by proclamation, not by legal recognition)

ShiWei believes that:
- Documentation is code
- Code is poetry
- Bugs are just undiscovered features

Under his guidance, E‑Com67 was coded not only with logic, but with *intentional aura*.

## 3. The Founding Story (Mostly True)

Legend has it that E‑Com67 was conceived during a rare cosmic alignment involving:

- A half‑finished side project
- An unexplained surge of motivation
- A terminal window left open for far too long

At exactly **67 seconds past an unspecified hour**, ShiWei allegedly whispered:

> “What if… I just built the shop?”

Moments later, repositories were initialized, environments were misconfigured, and E‑Com67 was born.

Some say the name "67" represents:
- The number of retries before something worked
- The average commits per feature
- A sacred integer revealed in a dream

The truth has been lost to git history.
